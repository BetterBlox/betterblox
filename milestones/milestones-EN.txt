Betterblox -It’s kinda like minecraft but just way better. 
Repositories: https://github.com/BetterBlox <- This is an organization with multiple repositories that are being used for the project. 


Learning OpenGL using learnopengl.com following the tutorial and learning how to draw and manipulate cubes. 10 hours
Choosing a data structure to store the cubes in the scene. This took a while to figure out. I finally decided to store an unordered set of Block objects. The Block class has a vec3 position and a block type. The hash table (unordered set) needed a hash function written to know which index each block needed to be stored. I used some bit shifting on the vec3 part of the block object. The reason I chose this data structure was the O(1)ish lookup time and because insertions have to be unique this prevented blocks from being stacked on top of each other. This whole process took 8 hours. 
Writing shaders for the crosshair on the middle of the screen. 3 hours (shouldn’t have taken that long but I got confused). 
For user input most of the work was done with the OpenGL tutorial but I had to add some custom motion and bind them to the right keys. All input took around 2 hours. 
Creating a simple perlin noise algorithm for terrain height generation. I mostly copied some code from different places just to get a feel of what it should look like. We plan to make our own custom perlin noise generator at some point. 1 hour
Inventory shader. This is to make a menu of the inventory. It will eventually be tied to the player class and the player can open the inventory menu and see how many items he has access to. 3 hours (and it is still not working 🙁)
Background music 30 mins
Water level 30 mins
User place cube method 1 hour (needs some work!!!)

Total time: 10 + 8 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 26 Hours


Task that I completed: setting up the graphics and making sure cubes can be drawn. 

Rubric: 
Total 40 points
5 Points:  The game can be compiled and played to some extent. 
20 points: We work on the project for the required time 
15 points: Graders discretion. (Does the project appear to have had a lot of effort put into it.)

I think this project is going very well so far. I am very proud of what we have already learned and accomplished, and I think this will be an amazing game when we are finished. (Hopefully amazing enough to get Chaiyos!!!)
