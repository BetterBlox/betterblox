+3hrs - A way to store block data into files and a way to read those files and return the blocks within the chunks.
        This is pretty important so that we can have save files of the minecraft world and so that we don't have to
        store everything in one data type like we have currently. The difficult part about this is that we need to make
        the files easily findable so that we aren't reading in a chunk that doesn't need to be read in.
+1hrs - Setting up development environment took a long time because originally we tried setting the environment up through
        Visual Studio however we realized that macOS does not support C++ on Visual Studio, so we switched over to CLion
        as our development environment

Tasked to make a file system to store world data like position of blocks and block identifications. Also made it so that
we keep world data in files separated by chunk files so that we don't have to read in a large text of data each time we
read the world's data. Since each world has millions of blocks within a small radius, all this information needs to be
seperated and organized so that the program takes less time to read the files and the game isn't so slow. These text
of world data will also be used to render in chunks of the world rather than rendering it in small bits at a time. The
stuff I made in src/Storage is not compilable with the project yet as I couldn't work on the project itself just until
recently so for now it is just a temporary file that can be replicated for our use.
